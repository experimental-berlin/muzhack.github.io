<p><a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/">Clouds</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doepfer_A-100">Eurorack</a> synthesizer module produced by the prolific French manufacturer <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/">Mutable Instruments</a>, whose innovative and stylish modules have become very popular since the company's inception in 2011.</p>

<p>While Mutable have a great variety of both digital and analog Eurorack modules under their belt, Clouds is a so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis">granular synthesizer</a>, meaning it is really an advanced type of sampler that chops the signal into many small pieces ("grains") which the player is afforded great control over through parameters such as grain size, density and pitch. These sample grains may be played back in an overlapping manner and often at differing speeds/sample positions/pitches/spatial positions so that together they form so called grain clouds, which ought to be what the name of this module alludes to.</p>

<p>Clouds is a bit different from conventional granular synthesizers, in that it focuses on real-time processing of incoming audio, rather than simply playing back samples (although it can do this too, by "freezing" its input). The really cool thing about this module is the ability to manipulate its synthesis parameters (e.g. grain size/density/pitch) through control voltage sent by other modules, which really opens up for a lot of interesting possibilities in sound shaping.</p>

<h2 id="alternativefirmware">Alternative Firmware</h2>

<p>Now, to the real topic of this post. Clouds, like Mutable's other offerings, is open, both when it comes to hardware and software. The community has taken advantage of this by producing alternative firmwares for it; I have installed the so-called <a href="https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/clouds.html">Parasite firmware</a> for it myself, and am very happy with the improvements it brings over the standard firmware!</p>

<p>Parasite offers the following modifications relative to the original firmware, according to its author Matthias Puech:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Oliverb, a new, full-featured creative reverb mode based on the reverb of the original firmware (itself based on a description of the Lexicon 480L), and inspired in design by the Erbe Verb, with CV control over all parameters. It is largely modeless, probably unrealistic and goes far beyond your traditional reverb.</li>
<li>Resonestor, a polyphonic resonator processor with built-in support for your beloved Karplus-Strong synthesis. Plucked or fed with your favorite sound, it spits out strange guitar sounds, lush chords, evolving drones, and more.</li>
<li>More envelopes for your grains: the Texture knob allows to select ramp down or ramp up-shaped grains. Square-shaped grains have steeper edges for extra glitch.</li>
<li>Availability of much smaller grains compared to the official firmware.</li>
<li>Enhanced looping delay and time stretcher modes: tempo syncing with clock multiplier/divisor, support for stereo delay (ping-pong delay) and (crude) open feedback loop, much improved sound quality, faster delay time change.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installingtheparasitefirmware">Installing the Parasite Firmware</h3>

<p>The Parasite firmware is installed <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/manual">in the same way as the standard firmware</a>; by playing back a .wav file into the module's input. The author warns that there have been cases of the module getting bricked as a result of replacing the firmware, but apparently they have been few and far between (approximately 1%). With an FTDI/JTAG adapter and a computer bricked modules should be  recoverable in any case.</p>
