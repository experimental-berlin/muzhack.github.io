        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Two major new features have been introduced in MuzHack: Dedicated bills of materials (BOMs) as part of build instructions (for now only available to GitHub based projects) and PDF versions of build instructions.</p>

<h2 id="dedicatedboms">Dedicated BOMs</h2>

<p>The benefits that dedicated BOMs bring are twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing BOMs has become drastically simpler for project authors, since they can simply write their BOMs as concise <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> files, which is much more user friendly than writing the same as Markdown tables. It means that BOMs are also semantically encoded, rather than just baked into the instructions document as regular text. See for example <a href="https://github.com/aknuds1/befaco-rampage/blob/master/muzhack/bom.yaml">the one for Befaco Rampage</a>, which is quite involved.  </li>
<li>BOMs are presented separately from the instructions themselves, and the containing section can be minimized in case the user wants to see just the instructions themselves.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="buildinstructionsaspdf">Build Instructions as PDF</h2>

<p>PDF documents are now auto generated for build instructions. Just click the corresponding link inside the Instructions tab, for example <a href="https://muzhack.com/u/aknudsen/befaco-rampage#instructions">Befaco Rampage</a>, and you'll download a document ready for printing a paper copy to have by your side as you're actually building the thing. Much more practical than having to check the computer...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the PDF documents have some ways to go when it comes to visual styling. Hopefully this will get better in the future. Remember though that MuzHack is <a href="https://github.com/muzhack/muzhack">open source</a> after all, and contributions to improve f.ex. the PDF functionality would be more than welcome!</p>
