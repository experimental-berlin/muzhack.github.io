        <section class="post-content">
            <p><a href="https://muzhack.com/u/aknudsen/musicthing-radiomusic">Music Thing Radio Music</a> is a DIY <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doepfer_A-100">Eurorack</a> module design by eminent instrument designer <a href="http://www.musicthing.co.uk/">Tom Whitwell</a>. This is a digital sample player module based on the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> microcontroller, that the author has released the full design for (i.e. it's open hardware and software) and does not actually sell himself. Typically, you'll buy a kit from e.g. <a href="https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/radio-music-full-diy-kit/">Thonk</a> and solder it yourself.</p>

<p>What's special about this module is that it digitally simulates the radio-powered experiments by avantgarde composers such as <a href="http://johncage.org/">John Cage</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>. It does this by providing 16 sample banks, corresponding to directories on the SD card, which each contain up to 75 "radio channels", each corresponding to a sound file. The module provides a "Station" knob, with which you can scan between the "stations" (continuously playing samples) of the currently active bank.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomWhitwell/RadioMusic/master/Collateral/img.png" alt="Radio Music"></p>

<p>For added fun and experimentation, there is also an input for automatically tuning the "radio" via voltage ("Tune"), which is typically sent by other parts of the modular synthesizer. This should provide for some unexpected results, as you can f.ex. generate random control signals from something like a <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/make-noise-wogglebug">Wogglebug</a> module.</p>

<p>In addition to the tuning functionality, there's a "Reset" button which will reset the playback position of the sample playing and it also has a control voltage input (named "Reset" too), which lets you reset playback in a controlled or random manner (all depending on what you feed it with).</p>

<p>The third main functionality is the "Start" knob, which controls the position where "Reset" will restart sample playback. This function too has a control voltage input to modulate its value automatically, which should have some fun potential.</p>

<h2 id="historicalbackground">Historical Background</h2>

<h3 id="johncage">John Cage</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo_in_Us">Wikipedia</a>: In July 1942 American experimental music composer, writer and visual artist John Cage wrote the musical composition Credo in Us. It was later revised in October of that year. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, this piece avoided the populist tendencies of fellow American composers at the time, while the piece's title is thought to be a call to collective unity.</p>

<p>Styled as "a dramatic playlet for Two Characters", Cage described Credo in Us as "a suite with a satirical character". It was composed to accompany a piece of contemporary dance choreographed by his partner and collaborator Merce Cunningham and choreographer Jean Erdman, who performed the piece at its premiere in Bennington College, Vermont on August 1, 1942.</p>

<p>The instrumentation for the original performance included four performers: a pianist; two percussionists playing muted gongs, tin cans, electric buzzer and tom-toms; and a fourth performer operating a radio and a phonograph. For the phonograph, Cage suggests using something "classic" such as Dvořák, Beethoven, Sibelius or Shostakovich; and for the radio, to use any station but avoid news programs in the case of a "national emergency". Jean Erdman recalls that for the first performance a 'tack-piano' was used—one of Cage's prepared pianos, though the pianist is also called upon to play the soundbox of the instrument as a percussionist.</p>

<h3 id="karlheinzstockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzwellen">Wikipedia</a>: In 1968, Karlheinz Stockhausen produced the composition Kurzwellen (Short Waves), for six players with shortwave receivers and live electronics. Each performer plays a series of events separated by pauses. An event may be played either with the radio or with an instrument, and it is also possible for a player to accompany an event on an instrument with the radio or vice versa, or to blend both together. Each event has a distinct duration defined by its subdivision into segments with a characteristic rhythm.</p>
